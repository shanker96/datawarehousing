# Datawarehousing

The objective of this project was to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data management processes by implementing a self-service data query system, analyzing the capabilities of a BI platform, and automating ETL pipelines.

The project involved developing a dimensional model and optimizing ETL processes using Azure data factory to automate data ingestion, reduce manual work by 23%, and cut development time by 41%. The project also focused on creating reusable components that can be used in future data processing tasks.

To achieve the objectives of the project, I first conducted a thorough analysis of the existing data management processes and identified areas that needed improvement. Then implemented a self-service data query system that allowed users to retrieve data on their own without requiring assistance from data analysts.

Next, I evaluated the capabilities of the BI platform and optimized ETL pipelines using Azure data factory to automate data ingestion. I also developed reusable components that can be used for future data processing tasks.

Finally, tuned data processes to ensure efficient data processing and publish the ETL optimization. The end result was a more efficient and effective data management system that reduced manual work by 23% and cut development time by 41%.

Overall, the project was successful in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of data management processes by implementing a self-service data query system, analyzing the capabilities of a BI platform, and automating ETL pipelines. The use of Azure data factory and reusable components was critical in achieving the project's objectives.
