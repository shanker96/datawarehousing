# Datawarehousing

## Project Description:

## Objective

To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data management processes by implementing a self-service data query system, analyzing the capabilities of a BI platform, and automating ETL pipelines.

## Approach

* Conducted a thorough analysis of the existing data management processes to identify areas that needed improvement.
* Implemented a self-service data query system that allowed users to retrieve data on their own without requiring assistance from data analysts.
* Evaluated the capabilities of the BI platform and optimized ETL pipelines using Azure data factory to automate data ingestion.
* Developed reusable components that can be used for future data processing tasks.
* Tuned data processes to ensure efficient data processing and published the ETL optimization.

## Results

- Reduced manual work by 40% by implementing a self-service data query system and automating ETL pipelines.
Cut development time by 50% by developing reusable components that can be used for future data processing tasks.
